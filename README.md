# 08-Endless-Runner
This is the seventh assignment for ILS-Z399: a side-scrolling 2D game.

Fork the repository, update the code, change the LICENSE and the README.md, and then submit a link to your repository on Canvas.

You have a lot more leeway on this assignment than on previous projects. The simplest version of this would probably be an endless runner, but any kind of 2D side-scroller will meet the requirements of the assignment.
